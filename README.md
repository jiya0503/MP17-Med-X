MED-X : AI Driven Healthcare system for Disease Prediction and Doctor Recommendation

Our aim is to create a website that uses machine learning algorithms to enhance user experience by providing patients results with optimum accuracy. 

The website (in progress) delivers personalized patient care by predicting diseases, providing tailored wellness recommendations like workout, diet and medication based on symptoms. 

Along with that leveraging advanced deep learning, we analyse image data for early disease detection and also connecting patients to nearby doctors and hospitals for comprehensive care according to their location.
